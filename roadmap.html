                <p class="pdfText">It cannot be ignored that the crypto currencies have altered most of the procedures
                    of the global finance systems,
                    since they have provided much more secure foundation. It
                    is a matter of time to observe the change in the asset
                    industry as well, since NFT’s will also provide a more secure,
                    fast, and clear foundation. The fastest changes may be with
                    assets that people buy for the entertainment and travel
                    industry since they can be implemented easily due to the
                    fact that these tickets can be consumed in a small period of
                    time, and this would increase the trust to the concept. On
                    the other hand, these changes may happen in a blink of a
                    time, without all these processes, if a global trading brand
                    decides to implement it to their system. Releasing an NFT
                    collection with this idea on our minds, is clearly serving this
                    cause.
                    One of the most exciting parts of contributing to an NFT project is being able become an investor
                    without having accumulated a serious amount of capital. In real life, it is almost
                    impossible to be an investor in a company with the transparency that the NFT projects are offering
                    to everyone.

                <p class="pdfText">It is an undeniable fact that the most important pillar of an NFT project is the
                    community. It should
                    not be overlooked that an NFT project
                    has many important pillars that need to be brainstormed, and in
                    some scenarios, even the absence of one leg can cause the project
                    to fail. <br></p>
                <p class="pdfText">Building a community requires special attention due to many aspects. It is also
                    obvious that
                    community should have its reasons to contribute to the project. For NFT projects, these reasons are
                    mostly financial, and the community is mainly seeking items that will benefit them
                    financially. Although the project provides very valid reasons for the
                    community to support the project, the most important element is that
                    the community supports itself and therefore the project. <br></p>

                    group named “The Lion’s
                    Share Club”, with some requirements to join, and basically, the indicator of being a part of this
                    community will be
                    acquiring a Silver or Gold VIP Card. These requirements are mainly to assess the value of being a
                    member of this
                    club. Specifically, the requirement of getting a Silver VIP Card is by exchanging it with 3
                    MetaLions, and similarly,
                    to acquire a Gold VIP Card is to burn 5 MetaLions.</p>

                    Obviously an NFT must have a value in order to make it worth buying, otherwise it would become a
                    worthless
                    asset. One of the most important contents an NFT has will undoubtedly be its market value, which
                    gets us into a
                    vicious circle. Because all the content created for NFTs also affects the market value, whereas
                    scenarios in which
                    the market value also affects itself have been seen.

                <p class="pdfText">
                    While an ordinary NFT project has only one asset to value, we have three; MetaLions NFT, Silver VIP
                    Card and
                    Gold VIP Card. It may seem hard to achieve this but as mentioned above, the strategy applied will be
                    extraordinary. In order to distribute 500 Silver VIP Cards, there will be 1500 MetaLions burnt and
                    likewise, there will be 500
                    MetaLions burnt for 100 Gold VIP Cards which will drastically increase the value of the MetaLions.

                    As can be seen in our roadmap, social events in both the metaverse and the real life will be
                    organized. Furthermore, it’s been planned to create an exclusive group for such events. Other than
                    that, MetaLion Land and
                    $LION airdrop will take place for the holders of the VIP Cards. Last but not least, MetaLion Land
                    will be introduced as a demo before the launch to the community

                <p class="pdfText">
                    Silver VIP Card owners will be able to attend special social events and receive MetaLion Land gifts.
                    Gold VIP Card owners will have all the rights that Silver VIP Card has, plus receive $LION and $SOL
                    drops along
                    with some other special airdrops. It’s beneficial to state that $LION token supply will be

                    once again prove the world the activity that NFTs may offer.</p>
                <p class="pdftext">
                    Furthermore, we will strengthen our hand by developing a game and implementing it
                    with our token for a P2E system. We will set the project up as much transparent as possible where
                    there won’t be any bosses, instead the project will be serving itself, while
                    offering the best of its support to the people who are contributing to the community.
                    So one of the things that we aim in the long-term is to provide the financial foundation
                    to our community so that they can make a living out of the above-mentioned goals.
